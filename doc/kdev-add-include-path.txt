### If KDevelop is missing the references from ./include do the following ###

To add the ./include directory to your KDevelop workspace do one of the following

a.) If your project's .kdev4 file at the root of the heirarchy has the same name as the directory
    it lives in, run:
    
       $ ./scripts/kdev-add-working-dir-include.sh
    
    It adds the following to .kdev4/<project name>.kdev4 (This file is different than the one in the root)
    
    Example:
    
        [CustomDefinesAndIncludes][ProjectPath0][Includes]
        1=/home/jonesy/projects/cpp/libtdata/include/

b.) If you like ugly manual ways of doing things...

    Right click project and click "Open Configuration..."
        1.) Select "Language Support"
        2.) Under "Includes and Imports" tab type include/ and click the "+" icon.
